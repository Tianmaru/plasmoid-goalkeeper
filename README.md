# GoalKeeper Plasmoid

> Help your zoomer brain stay on track.

GoalKeeper is a plasmoid plugin for KDE Plasma 5.

Currently, it's mostly based off the FuzzyClock plugin, but allows you to configure your current goal, which will be displayed in the task bar.

I just noticed that the timer widget aready allows you to set a title, so you might just want to use that instead.

# Installation

```shell
# copy plasmoid into
~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids
```

# TODO

- [ ] make GoalKeeper widget clickable to edit goal directly in expanded representation
- [ ] allow creating a list of tasks instead of a single goal
- [ ] add button to mark one task as done and switch to the next one
