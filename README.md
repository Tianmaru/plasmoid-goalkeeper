# GoalKeeper Plasmoid

> Help your zoomer brain stay on track.

GoalKeeper is a plasmoid plugin for KDE Plasma 5.

Currently, it's mostly based off the FuzzyClock plugin, but allows you to configure your current goal, which will be displayed in the task bar.

I just noticed that the timer plasmoid also allows you to set a title, so maybe just use that instead...

# Installation

```shell
# copy plasmoid into
~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids
```
